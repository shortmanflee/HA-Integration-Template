# Contributing to Your Home Assistant Integration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this Home Assistant integration! This document provides guidelines for contributing to an integration built from this template.

## Getting Started

This integration was built using the [HA-Integration-Template](https://github.com/shortmanflee/HA-Integration-Template). If you're creating your own integration from this template, please update this file with your specific contribution guidelines.

## Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- 🐛 **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- 💡 **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- 🔧 **Code Contributions**: Submit bug fixes or new features
- 📝 **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- 🧪 **Testing**: Add or improve test coverage

## Development Environment

### 🐳 Recommended: DevContainer Setup

The easiest and most reliable way to set up the development environment is using the included devcontainer:

#### Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

#### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-integration-name.git
   cd your-integration-name
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Start DevContainer**:
   - VS Code will detect the devcontainer configuration
   - Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   - Or use Command Palette: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

4. **Automatic Setup**: The devcontainer will automatically:
   - Set up Python 3.13 environment with virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Configure the development environment
   - Install recommended VS Code extensions
   - Forward port 8080 for Home Assistant

5. **Ready to Develop**: Everything is pre-configured and ready to use!

### 💻 Alternative: Local Development

If you prefer not to use containers:

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Home Assistant development environment
- Git

#### Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-integration-name.git
   cd your-integration-name
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config
   ln -sf $(pwd)/custom_components config/custom_components
   ```

### Using VS Code

This project includes VS Code tasks for common development operations:

- **Install Dependencies**: Set up the Python environment
- **Start Home Assistant (Development)**: Launch HA with the integration
- **Run Tests**: Execute the test suite
- **Lint and Fix with Ruff**: Format and check code quality

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: new feature description"
   ```

3. Push and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Standards

We use **Ruff** for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Check for issues
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues where possible
ruff check . --fix
```

**Code must pass all linting checks before being merged.**

### Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=custom_components
```

**Requirements:**
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- All tests must pass before merging

### Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update docstrings for all new functions/classes
2. Add type hints where appropriate
3. Update README.md if the public API changes
4. Consider adding examples for complex features

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Submitting**:
   - [ ] Code is properly formatted with Ruff
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] Documentation is updated
   - [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

2. **PR Description**:
   - Clearly describe what the PR does
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes

3. **Review Process**:
   - PRs require at least one review
   - Address all feedback before merging
   - Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
